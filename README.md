# Frozen_Shop
Let it go mah friend!
This was my first Hackathon and guess what? I was the capitain of the team *oh capitain, my capitain*
This project was the last one in our bootcamp of Academia de CÃ³digo *insert sad meme*
Let's go to the good part:

I started by choosing my teammates. 
I decided to choose a team that I knew would have good communication between the elements and with great backend strength.
Right from the start we decided that we were going to follow the Agile methodology.
As we had little time we started by trying sprints every 2 hours to find out how we were doing, rest a bit and drink a beer.
The random theme that came out to us was the song "Let it go" from the Frozen movie.

With the theme in hand, all I needed was an idea. After some discussion, we decided to make a subscription site.
Our objective with this site was the following:
Creation of the Customer Account,
Make a deposit to the account,
possibility to choose between the 3 subscriptions,
being able to make deposits in the account, 
modify the data and 
be able to delete the account

for the backend we use technologies such as: Spring MVC, RESTfull API, ORM, DAO, DataBase, 
always paying attention to maximum encapsulation and good practices

for the frontend we use the following: Javascript, html 5, CSS, DOM, JQuery, Ajax and Json.

Our biggest difficulty was getting the http requests right. 
But with Postman's help we did it. Another difficulty we had was connecting the backend to the frontend *it was hair pulling*
But we managed to succeed!
In the presentation part we did a Shark Tank demo, which was fun!
Out of 20 teams, we took 5th place!!

As soon as I have the opportunity I will take up this project again and try to improve what I can and make a better description of it.
Thanks for reading!
